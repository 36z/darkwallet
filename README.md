Dark Wallet
==========

We love Bitcoin, and the power it gives for trade and social connections. There is so much untapped power in Bitcoin. You know the saying "we only use 10% of our brain's power"? We probably use less than 1% of what is possible with Bitcoin!

We want to start with a simple premise: Bitcoin in your browser. We want a beautiful experience with privacy features built in by default.

This wallet will serve as a platform or a starting codebase to deliver a high quality Bitcoin that serves you, the users.
