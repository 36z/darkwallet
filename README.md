Dark Wallet [![Build Status](https://drone.io/github.com/darkwallet/darkwallet/status.png)](https://drone.io/github.com/darkwallet/darkwallet/latest) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/darkwallet/darkwallet/badge.png?branch=develop)](https://coveralls.io/r/darkwallet/darkwallet?branch=develop)
===========

We love Bitcoin, and the power it gives for trade and social connections. There is so much untapped power in Bitcoin. You know the saying "we only use 10% of our brain's power"? We probably use less than 1% of what is possible with Bitcoin!

We want to start with a simple premise: Bitcoin in your browser. We want a beautiful experience with privacy features built in by default.

This wallet will serve as a platform or a starting codebase to deliver a high quality Bitcoin that serves you, the users.

Running
-----------

You can load the extension into chrome by going to extensions, enabling development mode and clicking the "Load uncompressed extension" button.

Pre-Alpha!!!
-----------
We're still in pre-alpha state, that means we don't upgrade the application in backwards compatible way, and can still be upgraded often.

You are *very welcome* to test, just remember the following:
 * Write down your seed and be always ready to use it to restore the identity.
 * First thing you should do is get familiar with creating and restoring an identity.
 * You can do: "create new identity", choose same name as before and restore, this will upgrade your store (you will still need to re add pockets and addresses, contacts etc...)
 * If you notice strange behaviour after upgrading, you should:
    1. Restart the background process from darkwallet (from "manage extensions")
    2. If that doesn't work: Clear DarkWallet storage, (from darkwallet settings), restart chromium

We have been following this procedure since the wallet is under development without problems.

Remember: Your funds are safe as long as you *don't lose your seed* to restore later.

Other than that we're not making many guarantees.

I went to the store the other day to buy a bolt for our front door, for as I told the storekeeper, the governor was coming here. "Aye," said he, "and the Legislature too." "Then I will take two bolts," said I. He said that there had been a steady demand for bolts and locks of late, for our protectors were coming.
